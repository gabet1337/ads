\chapter{Introduction}
INTRO

\chapter{Implementation}
Talk about implementing fibonacci heap and binary heap

Implement
the Fibonnacci Heaps of Fredman and Tarjan,
the binary heaps of Williams (Algorithm 232, CACM 21(4), 1964).
As a minimum the following opeartions should be supported: MakeHeap, FindMin, Insert, DeleteMin, and DecreaseKey.

\chapter{Experiments}
Design and perform experiments where you try to measure the running time and number of comparisons of the operations for both priority queue implementations.

\chapter{Theory}
Argue about the worst-case (as opposed to amortized) time bounds for each of the operations of Fibonnacci Heaps and binary heaps.

\chapter{Dijkstra's algorithm}
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for the single-source shortest path problem for a weighted graph with non-negative edge-weigths, such that is can switch between the two priority queue implementations.
Describe families of graphs where Dijkstra's algorithm performs many respectively few DecreaseKey operations.

\chapter{Experiments on Dijkstra's}
Perform experiments on your implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm - in particular, try to observe if the version using Fibonacci heaps achieves an improved performance because of the amortized O(1) time DecreaseKey operation.
